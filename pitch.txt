Game Summary:

A long time ago, in a land far, far away...

It is a period of unrest for the creatures of the forest. As human's are encroaching onto the land, for the ever lasting thirst for resources.
You, the dryad, the protector of said forest, have to unleashed all sort of defenses such as plant traps, fearless beasts, and mythological creatures, 
in an effort to keep your homeland safe from destruction and wipe out the human threat.
--------
Goal and Mechanics:

Your job as the protector of the forest is to help your home to flourish, while defending against hordes of humans.

You're encouraged to spread your territory, to keep a consistent stream of resources flowing in.
There's human settlements scattered all across the map, which will ocassionally spawn in humans.
To stop humans from spawning in, you'll have to destroy these settlements(removing the settlement from the map entirely), either through brute force,
or to restrict their flow of resources, until they either starve (resulting in the settlement turning into ruins, which the player can take over), or until they 
decide to relocate and create a new camp (this will happen when the player fails to eliminate all escape routes).
--------
Win Condition:
--------
When all human settlements are eliminated.

Lose Condition: 
---------
When the God Tree is destroyed (You'll have to protect this tree from the humans).
---------
Levels: 

The game has one main level. This is the map that you spawn in. Human settlements and resources are spawn randomly all across the world.

Once the main design is complete, and if we have time, we may create more maps which will be unlocked once the player has beaten the main game.

Sources of inspiration:

The idea comes from a reddit thread, however, i've made a few alterations to it, so that it would resemble more of a civilization/survival game.
Additionally, some fantasy elements and mechanics were added so the game would feel more fulfilling and indept.

Concept:

The game would follow a design similar to the Don't Starve series: https://bit.ly/3nyImnM || https://bit.ly/3jzYuV1

Or maybe a mix between terraria and certain 2D platformers like Celeste and Hollow Knight: https://bit.ly/3vMCR8M || https://bit.ly/3nv0T4o || https://bit.ly/3vKL4KC

Ideally, I would like to add elements such as falling leaves, visual wind effects and footsteps to make the game look more aesthetic: https://bit.ly/3CkjGFI
